# Learn `rendy`

`rendy` is a 'build-your-own-renderer' toolkit built on top of `gfx-hal`. It
provides many helpers and conveniences to assist you in writing a rendering
engine. However, it does *not* hide all the complexities of `gfx-hal` from
its user, and even in the places where it does provide help, knowledge of the
underlying concepts is invaluable if not required. With that in mind, this guide
is going to assume that you already have a working knowledge of `gfx-hal`. If you
don't, I highly recommend checking out Lokathor's awesome set of tutorials,
[`learn-gfx-hal`](https://github.com/Lokathor/learn-gfx-hal), which this repository
is somewhat (okay, a little more than somewhat) inspired by. If you can get through
those tutorials, then you'll (hopefully) be prepared to take on these as well.

## What this book and repo is

This book is an introductory guide to using `rendy` which will hopefully describe
what `rendy` does, how you can use it, and provide examples which you can build off
of to make your own projects.
